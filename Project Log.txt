        **Modified FLListDisplay to use one Fl Callback for all its child windows.


To do:
        FlStockTransactionDisplay
         -- move button group for particulars to top left corner of add box. to archive remove current
            structurally confusion of current arrangment.
         -- reimplement add handler logic as follows: factor out loaditem draw code in writebuff into own method,
         -- and have writebuff copy the data into internal storage and call the method instead; rearrange add 
            handler to also call the draw routine.
        

Notes:
        DISPLAY NAMING SCHEME.
        Naming of displays is as follows. Winny::Application, the controller defines a set of names.
        and requires the UI::screen to have implemented them. All its messages (protocal) between. the
        controller and the UI module use these names. Each name is unique. the names are defined in a 
        general header and any module that wishes to communicate a screen command uses these.
        
        on startup, winny extracts a user's role, which is a set of display names that the user has 
        access to. and writes it in its state object. it starts the screen, and writes it's state to the
        screen. the screen passes the role set to constructdisplay function, which for each screen name
        in the role list,  it calls a constructor the rightful display. and inserts it in the display table
        and updates the general user menue with that display's id()/description string, and stores in each
        display its name (probable we need to change this so that displays nave an id to return name of screen
        they implement)
